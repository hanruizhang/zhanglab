>### _The goal of the Zhang laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms and therapeutic implications of macrophage heterogeneity and plasticity in cardiometabolic diseases._  

Dr. Zhang's laboratory seeks to understand the dynamic role of macrophages in cardiometabolic diseases with the aim of finding novel mechanisms and new treatments. The laboratory applies technologies for high-throughput functional genomics, human iPSC and CRISPR gene editing, transgenic mouse models, human genetics, and a variety of cell and molecular techniques. 

**The main areas of research in the laboratory include:**        

* Functional genomics and mechanistic studies of candidate genes and genetic variants inspired by human genome-wide association studies of cardiometabolic traits. [R01-HL-168174](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/zQE0vAern0yY4dtpLdbNag/project-details/10639274){:target="_blank"} and [R00-HL-130574](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9765372&icde=49755340&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=){:target="_blank"}        

* Unbiased CRISPR screening to discover novel regulators of macrophage function, in particular, macrophage efferocytosis, and investigate their roles in homeostasis and diseases, including atherosclerosis. [R01-HL-151611](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9945435&icde=49996451&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=2&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=){:target="_blank"} and [P01-HL-172741](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/K2fNMZHVak-41arV2rBvdA/project-details/10849324){:target="_blank"}.      

* Disease modeling and functional genomic studies in human iPSC-derived macrophages.
